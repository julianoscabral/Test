# Formal description of an eco-evolutionary model to test LDG hypotheses

This is preliminary model description, roughly following the ODD protocol (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) for describing agent-based models (Grimm et al. 2010). Everybody is welcome to contribute, optimize description, write equations, sketch figures and write pseudocode. 

## Purpose
This model has a general purpose to unveil the misteries of biodiversity dynamics and their governing rules. However, until we get there the more immediate purpose is to test hypotheses addressing the Latitudinal Gradient of Diversity (from now on LDG). Because we aim to address as many hypotheses as possible, the model needs to accordingly accomodate the processes, structure and properties necessary to integrate assumptions and to generate predicted patterns (beyond the LDG) evoked the various hypotheses. Most importantly, we discussed model properties with the general aim of defining a model that generates speciation as an emergent process (i.e. as a product of trait/niche divergence, which per se should be influenced by ecological, evolutionary and environmental processes).    

## Model Properties, State variables and scales:
* Spatially-explicit: Generalized grid of cells, potentially in the rough shape of North/South America. Grid cells can be interpreted as buckets with different properties depending on the location in the grid.  
* Niche-based:
